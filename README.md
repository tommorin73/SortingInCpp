# SortingInCpp
COMP 2710 Project 3

This program takes input from two different files and writes its output to a third file. Each input file contains a list of numbers of type int in sorted order from the smallest to the largest. After the program is run, the output file will contain all the numbers in the two input files in one longer list in sorted order from smallest to largest.

I recieved a 100/00 on this assignment.

The sample/test input files are included in the repository.
